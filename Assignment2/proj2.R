# ------- Outline of project----------------------------------------------------

#    We simulated the prisoner-box problem to estimate probabilities for 3 strategies.
# Prisoners open a sequence of boxes of length 2*n to find their number inside. Under
# strategy 1 they start the sequence by opening a box with their number,
# under strategy 2 they start with a random box, in both cases they continue 
# the search by opening boxes according to cards they found in the previous one.
# Under strategy 3 they pick all boxes in random order.
#
#    We constructed a function Pone to estimate the probability of one prisoner
# finding a card with their pre-assigned number inside shuffled boxes.
# We then built a function Pall which estimates the probability of all prisoners finding
# the cards with their pre-assigned number in shuffled boxes.
#
#    We also constructed a function dloop that estimates probabilities of each loop length
# ranging from 1 to 2*n occurring at least once in a given number of simulations.
# A plot is provided to visualize the probabilities. We find the probability that 
# there is no loop longer than 50 using the previously written dloop function for n=50.

# Observations:
 #   What surprises us of the estimated probabilities is that the probability
 # of all prisoners (Pall) successfully finding their cards asymptotically 
 # converges to 0.31 as n goes to infinity for strategy 1, while for strategies 2 
 # and 3 the probabilities converges to 0 as n grows larger.
 #   
 #   The results we observed for Pall is a stark contrast compared to the 
 # probabilities we observed for Pone. For strategies 1 and 3 in Pone, the 
 # estimated probabilities converge to 0.5, and 0.375 for strategy 2. Hence, we
 # expected Pall to follow the same pattern but it does not.
 #   
 #   While all three strategies were somewhat successful for Pone, only strategy
 # 1 proved to be useful for Pall.
