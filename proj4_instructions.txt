- objective or derivatives are not finite at the initial theta - error
- count the iteriaions (if max reach - error)
- if hess is null (create hessian); if not check if it's pd with chol()
- evaluate the step
- evalueate D(theta +step)
- check D(theta +step) < D(theta); if not: havlve the step with a while loop; if max.half reached - error
- check convergance: 
		*check grad = 0 (with tol) and pd for hessian (error if not)
		*all elements of the gradient vector have absolute value less
		  than tol times the absolute value of the objective function plus fscale
- evaluate grad, hessian at new_theta
