# ------- Outline of project----------------------------------------------------

# We simulated the prisoner-box problem to estimate probabilities for 3 strategies.
# We constructed a function PONE to estimate the probability of one prisoner
# finding a card with their pre-assigned number inside shuffled boxes.
# We then built a function PALL which estimates the probability of all prisoners finding
# the cards with their pre-assigned number in shuffled boxes.
# We also constructed a function DLOOP that estimates probabilities of each loop length
# ranging from 1 to 2*n occurring at least once in a given number of simulations.
# A plot is provided to visualise the probabilities. We find the probability that 
# there is no loop longer than 50 using the previously written DLOOP function for n=50.
